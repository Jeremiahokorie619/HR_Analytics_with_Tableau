The columns in the dataset are as follows:

**[Employee_ID,	First Name,	Last Name,	Gender,	State,	City,	Education Level,	Birthdate,	Hiredate,	Termdate,	Department,	Job Title,	Salary,	Performance Rating]**

The dashboard will be created with Tableau public and will be made up of two **pages**:

1. Summary page
   
2. Details page

### **1. Summary Page**
The summary page will be made up of three main sections with their respective sub-sections:

#### **1.1 Overview**

##### **1.1.1 Active Employees**
  i. Total number of **active** employees
  ii. Total number of **hired** employees
  iii. Total number of **terminated** employees

##### **1.1.3 Locations**

#### **1.2 Demographics**
Here we will be visualizing the distribution of hired employees across several fields.

##### **1.2.1 Gender**

  i. Pie-Charts/ Donut Charts showing the distribution of **hired** and **terminated** employees per Gender (Male/Female)

##### **1.2.2 Education & Age**

  i. Three charts showing the Distribution of **Active** employees in the company with respect to the various Educational levels (High_School, Bachelors, Masters and PhD) and the different age groups (<25, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54 and 55+)

#### **1.3 Income**
Here we will be visualizing the salary distribution across several fields. 

##### **1.3.1 Education & Gender**

i. A Gap chart will be used to visualize the differences in average pay (Average Salary) between both Genders with respect to the various Educational levels

##### **1.3.2 Age & Salary**

i. A scatter plot will be used to visualize the average salary distribution of different Job Titles with respect to Age

### **2. Details Page**

This page simply contains a list of important employee data (with appropriate filters) such as:

1. ID Number
2. Full Name (First Name + Last Name)
3. Role (Department/Job Title)
4. Geographics (Branch or HQ)
5. Salary
6. Status
7. Length of Employment (in years)

The filters will allow us to narrow down to any employee, given that we have any of the information above.

## INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

1. The average salaries of male and female employees seem to favour the males at a lower educational level (High School and Masters) but favours the females at a higher educational level (Master and PhD)
2. HR Managers seem to be the only Job Title that earns($82,203) above the overall average salary ($77,934) despite having an average age(32) below the overall average age (41). This indicates an outlier in the company payment structure and could be adjusted
